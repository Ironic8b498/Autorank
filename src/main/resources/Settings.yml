# If a compatible AFK plugin is found Autorank will not count online time for AFK players
# Autorank automatically chooses what plugin to use for AFK integration.

interval check: 1
# This is the interval between checks of Autorank (in minutes).
# Lowering this number will increase accuracy but will also increase server lag.

# All these options are for configuring your MySQL database with Autorank.
# Hostname has to include a port, but doesn't have to be port 3306.

auto-updater:
  check-for-new-versions: true
#   When check-for-new-versions is true, Autorank will tell you when a new version is available.

advanced dependency output: false
# If this is true, Autorank will tell you in the console what dependencies were found and which ones weren't found.
# Turn this off to remove the console spam from Autorank about dependencies.
# This feature can be useful when Autorank can't find your dependency, but you have it installed.

show help command based on permission: false
# If this is true, the /ar help command will only show the available commands for a certain player.
# If a player doesn't have the permission to perform the command, it will not show that command on the help page.

use debug: false
# Only set this to true when you want to debug Autorank
# When this is true, Autorank will spit out debug messages

show warnings: true
# Whether Autorank has to show critical warnings.
# Leave this set to true. You can only change it to false when Autorank is giving you false warnings.

use primary group for vault: true
# Most permission plugins will only work properly with Autorank if you let it only get the primary group.
# Some need to get all the groups however. You probably only need to change this when a dev tells you to.

broadcast resetting of data files: true
# Autorank keeps track of amount of time played per day, week and month.
# When a new day, week or month starts, Autorank will reset the times of all players (except the total time, this is always preserved).
# If this value is set to true, Autorank will broadcast to all players when their storage gets reset.

use global time in leaderboard: false
# By default, Autorank will use the local time of a player when for the leaderboard. When this is set to true,
# /ar leaderboard will be sorted on the global time of a player (provided that it exists).

disable automatic path checking: false
# By default, Autorank will check whether a player meets all requirements for its path every x minutes.
# If you want to disable this feature and let players manually check whether they completed all requirements, set this to true.

automatically archive old data: true
# This is turned on by default. When this is set to true, Autorank will archive storage of players that haven't seen been online for some time.

primary storage provider: flatfile
# Set the primary storage provider for Autorank. By default, this is the flatfile provider that stores data in the
# /storage folder. The primary storage provider is used to get the time a player has played when for example
# /ar times is requested. You can choose from 'flatfile' or 'mysql'.

automatically remove backups if older than: 14
# Set how old a backup must be before it will be removed (in days).

automatically update this file with new options: true
# Whether Autorank should automatically update this file with new options (when they are introduced). This will
# also automatically remove options if they are not relevant anymore.
# You should leave this on to have the latest options available. If you're having trouble with this file overwriting
# your changes, you can try turning this feature off.

enable logging: true
# It is recommended to let Autorank log messages when you run into trouble or can't understand what it is doing.
# You can find the logs in the Autorank folder (under logging)
# If you want to disable logging, set this to false.

show detailed path when only one active path: false
# If this is true, Autorank will do the following when /ar check:
# It will check if the player has only one active path. If that's the case, it will show the details of that specific
# path. However, if this settings is false, Autorank will always show an overview of all active paths when doing
# /ar check. You can experiment with this setting and see the difference! This setting is mostly useful when you are
# sure that players will never have more than one path at the same time.
